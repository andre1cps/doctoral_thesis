# Doctoral thesis

## Description

Studies related to my atmospheric physics doctoral thesis entitled "Evaluating the atmospheric origins and ecological impacts of current and future drought events in South America using complex networks".

### Summary

Over the last decade the network abstraction as a paradigm for complex dynamical systems has become a tremendously successful new tool in various scientific fields, including neuronal and molecular biology, ecology, engineering, economy, social sciences and even Earth sciences research. The latter is a special challenge for network theory, because each of Earth’s subsystems act and interact at different time and spatial scales. Nonetheless, complex network methods have allowed us to characterize the Earth’s climate and its components, for instance, revealing the influence of ongoing deforestation and fires in the Amazon, the formation of extreme floods in the Eastern Central Andes or the cascading of atmospheric moisture transport over South America. In this PhD project the student will make use of complex network approaches in conjunction with other classical or modern techniques of data analysis from multivariate statistics, nonlinear dynamics and machine learning, to identify the impacts of drought events on forest ecosystems and the atmospheric mechanisms leading to these drought events, under current and future global environmental change.
